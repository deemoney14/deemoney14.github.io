This is my first official project outside of class, inspired by online research. I decided to start with something that seemed simpleâ€”deploying WordPress on an EC2 instance. Sure, I could have done it easily via the AWS console, but where's the fun in that? Instead, I chose to use a cloud-agnostic tool called Terraform (oooo, scaryyyyy!).
My plan was to create an EC2 instance with an attached security group, use a user-data script to install WordPress, and deploy everything within the default VPC in the us-west-1 region. Sounded simple enough in my head.
The first hurdle came when I discovered I had accidentally deleted my default VPC.  I could have switched to another region, but whereâ€™s the fun in that? Instead, I decided to create a new VPC from scratch. I set up the VPC with one subnet, one  (AZ), an (IGW), and the necessary route tables and associations. The Terraform documentation was key to getting this done.

 
With the VPC set up, it was time to provision my EC2 instance. This part was trickier than expected because I couldnâ€™t find the user-data script to install WordPress. Thank you, ChatGPT! I finally got the script and also learned a neat trick: outputting the instance IP address directly in Terraform using: output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
This little trick saved me from having to hunt through the console for the IP address. My naming conventions still need some work, but Iâ€™m sure that will improve over time.
 

Last part was suppose to be the easier, but I struggles only because I had too many options on the documents. I think was overwhelm and didnâ€™t know which one to use. I used aws_security_group and also used aws_security_group_ingress_rules not knowing all I did was duplicate it. LOL. I rememver in class we used security_group_rule with aws_security_group, I didnâ€™t go that route. Watched some youtube videos and reliazed that I can use include ingress  in aws_security_group. Now, terraform init, plan and apply. Everything is but I cant get ascess to my wordpress. I go over to the console and everything seems correct on my end. I remember from class if you have  issues with internet, its most likely resulting fromt eh secituty group. 

The last part was supposed to be the easiestâ€”setting up the security groupâ€”but I ran into issues because I was overwhelmed with too many documentation options. At first, I used both aws_security_group and aws_security_group_ingress_rule, not realizing I had essentially duplicated the same rules. LOL.
In class, we had used security_group_rule with aws_security_group, but I decided to do it my own way. After watching some YouTube tutorials, I realized I could include the ingress rules directly in the aws_security_group resource.
With everything in place, I ran terraform init, plan, and apply. Everything deployed successfully, but I couldnâ€™t access my WordPress site. After some head-scratching and double-checking in the AWS console, I remembered from class: if there are internet issues, itâ€™s likely related to the security group.




 
Sure enough, my security group had no outbound rules. I quickly added an egress rule, and...  
Look at this nowâ€”WordPress is up and running! ðŸš€  
I terraform destroyed to save on cost.
