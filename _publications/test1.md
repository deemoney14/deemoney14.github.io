Architecture Overview

The goal of this project was to implement a secure and scalable WordPress deployment using AWS services. I designed a three-tier architecture to optimize performance and security, separating the web, application, and database layers. This setup not only enhances security but also improves scalability and fault tolerance by leveraging multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
