This is my first official project outside of class, inspired by online research. I decided to start with something that seemed simpleâ€”deploying WordPress on an EC2 instance. Sure, I could have done it easily via the AWS console, but where's the fun in that? Instead, I chose to use a cloud-agnostic tool called Terraform (oooo, scaryyyyy!).
